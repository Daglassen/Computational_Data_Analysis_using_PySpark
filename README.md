**EXPLAINABLE CLASSIFICATION OF X-RAY IMAGES USING BAYESIAN DEEP
LEARNING** <br>

**From Abstract** <br>

In this project, we use a Bayesian Neural Network to classify
the body part present in an X-ray image, and use different
methods to explain how our network made this classification.
We will analyze our network’s decision making process by
obtaining posterior distributions for the network’s last layer
of weights, identifying the regions of the X-ray our network
considers relevant in making this classification, and evaluating
the certainty of the model weights. A convolutional neural
network will be built and Class Activation Maps will be used
to attribute relevance to features of the X-ray images. Uncertainty
analysis will be incorporated via Bayesian Neural
Network translation using Laplace Approximation. We find
that the Class Activation Maps successfully aid in the interpretation
of the networks decision making process. We also
find how evaluating the uncertainty of a network’s weights is
significant in increase its explainability.
